            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>CRITICAL FINANCIAL TERM:</strong> All subscriptions for ClgEdu ERP are sold on a strict <strong>Pre-Paid Annual Basis</strong>. Post-paid or monthly payment options are NOT available unless explicitly authorized in a separate written contract.
            </div>

            <h3>5.1 MANDATORY ONE-YEAR CONTRACT (LOCK-IN PERIOD)</h3>
            <p>By purchasing a subscription, the Educational Institution ("Client") agrees to a mandatory <strong>Lock-in Period of One (1) Year</strong> (12 Months) from the date of activation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Partial Cancellation:</strong> The Client cannot cancel the subscription after 3 months, 6 months, or any duration less than 1 year.</li>
                <li><strong>Liability for Full Term:</strong> Even if the Client chooses to discontinue using the Software mid-year, they remain liable for the full 12-month subscription cost.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 100% ADVANCE PAYMENT RULE</h3>
            <p>To activate the Service, the Client must adhere to the following payment schedule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upfront Payment:</strong> The Client must pay <strong>100% of the Annual Subscription Fee</strong> (for 12 months) + applicable GST <strong>IN ADVANCE</strong> before the account is activated.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Activation:</strong> The ERP setup, app generation, and training will commence ONLY after the payment is credited to Aditya Divte Production’s bank account. Cheque presentation or screenshot of transfer is not sufficient proof of credit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.3 NO REFUND POLICY (STRICT)</h3>
            <p>Once the payment is processed and the account setup has begun (even if no students have logged in yet), the fees paid are <strong>NON-REFUNDABLE</strong> under any circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Change of mind by the College Management or Trustees.</li>
                <li>Lack of usage by students or staff.</li>
                <li>Closing down of the institution.</li>
                <li>Disagreement with features that were already described in the Demo.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.4 RENEWAL & PRICE PROTECTION</h3>
            <p>The Advance Payment covers the subscription for exactly 365 days.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Renewal Notice:</strong> The Client must pay the renewal fee 15 days before the expiry of the current term to avoid service interruption.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Hikes:</strong> Aditya Divte Production reserves the right to increase subscription prices for the <em>next</em> renewal term. The current advance payment protects the Client from price hikes only for the current active year.</li>

            <div class="danger-box">
                <strong>STRICT NOTICE REQUIREMENT:</strong> To discontinue the Service, the Client must provide <strong>One (1) Year's Prior Notice</strong>. Immediate cancellation is NOT permitted under this Agreement.
            </div>

            <h3>6.1 THE "365-DAY" NOTICE RULE</h3>
            <p>The Client acknowledges that ClgEdu ERP requires significant server resources and data retention planning. Therefore, if the Client wishes to discontinue or stop using the Service, they must submit a formal <strong>"Request for Discontinuation"</strong> in writing to Aditya Divte Production exactly <strong>365 Days (1 Year)</strong> before the intended date of stopping the service.</p>

            <h3>6.2 APPROPRIATION OF ADVANCE PAYMENT</h3>
            <p>Upon receiving the Discontinuation Notice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advance Adjustment:</strong> The <strong>One-Year Advance Payment</strong> already made by the Client for the current active term shall be treated as the fee for this mandatory notice period.</li>
                <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Since the notice period is 1 year, and the payment is for 1 year, the Advance Payment will be fully utilized to cover the service costs until the termination date. <strong>No portion of the Advance Payment will be refunded.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Service Continuation:</strong> The App and ERP will remain fully active for the students during this 1-year notice period until the prepaid balance is exhausted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.3 AUTOMATIC RENEWAL (FAILURE TO NOTIFY)</h3>
            <p>If the Client fails to provide the mandatory 1-Year Notice before the expiration of the current term:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Subscription shall <strong>Automatically Renew</strong> for another 1 Year.</li>
                <li>The Client will be legally liable to pay the Advance Fee for the subsequent year.</li>
